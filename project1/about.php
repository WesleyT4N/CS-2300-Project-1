      I'm currently a full-time undergraduate student attending Cornell University's College of Engineering.
      Majoring in Computer Science and with a planned minor in Business, my main area of expertise is software development.
      On the side, I enjoy both playing and listening to music along with gaming and watching movies.
      I'm currently in the middle of my intership search and am looking forward to putting the skills I've obtained over the years
      into practical use.
